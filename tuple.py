# tuple data structure 
# tuple can store any data type 
# most important tuples are immutable, once tuple created we can't change 
# data inside tuple

# no append, no insert , no pop , no remove
# days = ('monday', 'tuesday')
# tuple are faster than lists 

# methods 
# count, index
# len funtion
# slicing 

# mixed = (1,2,4,5,6)
# for i in mixed:
#     print(i)


#single tuple can be written in (1,) this form 

#tuple unpacking 
fruits = 'apple','mango','banana'
a, b, c = (fruits)
